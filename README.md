# Palindrome Checker (Java)
### 📌 Description

This is a simple Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., madam, racecar).

The program:

Takes a string input from the user.

Reverses the string.

Compares the reversed string with the original string.

Prints whether the string is a palindrome or not.

### ⚙️ Features

Works for any user-input string.

Displays both the original and reversed string.

Clearly shows if the input is a palindrome.

### 🛠️ Compilation & Execution

Save the program as Practice.java.

Open a terminal/command prompt in the same directory.

## Compile the program:
```
javac Practice.java
```
## Run the program:
```
